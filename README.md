This work is about prompt engineering at scale utilizing Azure Open AI LLM model.

In this project, we will try to build small generative ai solution to demonstrate various prompt engineering techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, COT (Chain of Thought) etc.

Title: Understanding Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction

**Objective:**
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Define Newton's Third Law of Motion.
2. Identify action and reaction force pairs in various scenarios.
3. Explain real-life applications of Newton's Third Law.

**Body:**

**1. What is Newton's Third Law?**
   - Explain that Newton's Third Law states: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."
   - Break down the meaning of this law: when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first object.

**2. Action and Reaction Pairs:**
   - Provide examples and ask students to identify the action and reaction force pairs in each scenario. Examples could include:
     - A person pushing against a wall.
     - A ball bouncing off the ground.
     - A swimmer pushing against the water.
   - Encourage students to think about the forces involved and how they act on different objects.

**3. Real-Life Applications:**
   - Discuss real-life examples where Newton's Third Law is at play, such as:
     - Rocket propulsion: The action force is the expulsion of gas from the rocket engines, and the reaction force is the resulting upward movement of the rocket.
     - Walking: Each step involves pushing against the ground, which pushes back with an equal force, propelling the person forward.
     - Driving a car: The tires push against the road, and the road pushes back, propelling the car forward.
   - Encourage students to brainstorm other examples they encounter in daily life.
   
**Conclusion:**
Review the key points of the lesson:
- Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- Action and reaction force pairs exist in all interactions between objects.
- Understanding Newton's Third Law helps us explain and predict motion in the world around us.

**Assessment:**
Conduct a short quiz or discussion to assess students' understanding of Newton's Third Law and their ability to identify action and reaction force pairs in different scenarios. Encourage students to ask questions if they need further clarification.
